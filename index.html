          <p class="bg-dark text-white">Question 1: Who developed Python Programming language?</p>
          <p class="bg-success text-white">Answer 1: Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s while he was working at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI) in the Netherlands. It was first released in 1991, and since then it has grown in popularity and become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. Guido van Rossum continued to lead the development of Python until 2018, when he retired from his role as the "Benevolent Dictator For Life" (BDFL) of the Python community. Today, Python is an open-source project with a large and active community of developers who contribute to its ongoing development and improvement.

          <p class="bg-dark text-white">Question 2: Which type of programming does python support?</p>
          <div class="bg-success text-white">
          <p class="bg-success text-white">Answer 2: Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that supports multiple programming paradigms, including:
          </br>
            <li>Procedural programming: Python supports writing code in a step-by-step manner that executes a series of instructions to achieve a specific task.</li>
            
            <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP): Python allows developers to create classes, objects, and methods that interact with each other to achieve a specific goal.</li>
            
            <li>Functional programming: Python supports writing code in a functional programming style, where functions are treated as first-class citizens and can be passed as arguments to other functions or returned as values.</li>
            
            <li>Scripting: Python is often used as a scripting language, where scripts are written to automate tasks or perform specific actions.</li> </p>
        </ol>
        </div>
          <p class="bg-dark text-white">Question 3: Is Python casse sensitive when dealing with identifiers?</p>
          <p class="bg-success text-white">Answer 3: Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language when it comes to identifiers. This means that variables, functions, classes, and other identifiers in Python are distinguished by their case.

            For example, the variables myVar, myvar, and MYVAR are three different variables in Python, and assigning a value to myVar will not affect the values of myvar or MYVAR. </p>
          <p class="bg-dark text-white">Question 4: What is the correct extension of the python file?</p>
          <p class="bg-success text-white">Answer 4: The correct extension to save a python file is by ending the name of the file with '.py' extension. It depicts that the file is containing the python code.</p>
          <p class="bg-dark text-white">Question 5: Is Python code compiled or interpreted?</p>
          <p class="bg-success text-white">Answer 5: Python is an interpreted language, which means that Python code is executed line by line, in a sequential manner, by the Python interpreter. When you run a Python program, the source code is first compiled into bytecode, which is a low-level representation of the code that can be executed by the Python interpreter. The bytecode is then interpreted by the Python interpreter, which executes the instructions and produces the output.

            Unlike compiled languages, such as C++ or Java, Python does not need to be compiled into machine code before it can be executed. This means that Python programs can be developed and run quickly, without the need for a lengthy compilation process.
            
            However, it's worth noting that some Python implementations, such as PyPy, do include a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, which can improve the performance of Python code by compiling parts of the code into machine code at runtime. This can make Python code run faster, especially for certain types of applications, such as numerical computation or machine learning. </p>
            
            
          <p class="bg-dark text-white">Question 6: Name a few blocks of code used to define in python language?</p>
          <p class="bg-success text-white">Answer 6: In Python, code blocks are defined using indentation rather than curly braces or other delimiters. Here are a few examples of code blocks in Python:
          </br><ol><li>Function definitions: In Python, functions are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and a set of parentheses that can contain parameters. 
          </br> For example:-> def greet(name):
          </li>
          <li>
            Control structures: Python uses control structures such as if, else, while, and for to control the flow of execution in a program.
            </br>
                For example:-> x=10</br>
                if x > 0:
            </br>
                print("x is positive")
            </br>
                else:
            </br>
                print("x is negative or zero")

          </li>  
        </ol></p>
          <p class="bg-dark text-white">Question 7: State a character used to give single-line comments in python?</p>
          <p class="bg-success text-white">Answer 7:  In Python, the '#' character is used to indicate a single-line comment. When the Python interpreter encounters a '#' character in a line of code, it ignores the rest of the line and does not execute it.
          </p>
          <p class="bg-dark text-white">Question 8: Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?</p>
          <p class="bg-success text-white">Answer 8: 
            In Python, there are several functions and methods that can help you find the version of Python that you are currently working with. Here are a few examples:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    sys.version: The sys module provides access to the Python interpreter's system-specific
                    parameters and functions. The version attribute of the sys module contains a string that 
                    represents the version number of the Python interpreter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    platform.python_version(): The platform module provides access to information about the platform on which 
                    the Python interpreter is running. The python_version() function of the platform module returns a string 
                    that contains the version number of the Python interpreter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    sys.version_info: The sys module also provides the version_info attribute, which contains a tuple that 
                    represents the version number of the Python interpreter in a more structured format. The tuple contains 
                    five elements: the major version number, the minor version number, the micro version 
                    number, the release level, and the serial number.
                </li>
            </ol>

          </p>
          <p class="bg-dark text-white">Question 10: What does pip stand for a python?</p>
          <p class="bg-success text-white">Answer 10:  In Python, "pip" stands for "Pip Installs Packages" or "Pip Installs Python". Pip is a package manager for Python that allows you to install and manage third-party libraries and modules that are not part of the standard Python library. Pip simplifies the process of installing and managing external dependencies in your Python projects. It also provides a convenient way to distribute and share Python packages with others.
            You can use pip to install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) or other package repositories, upgrade or uninstall packages, and manage package dependencies. Pip is included with most Python installations, and you can use it from the command line by running pip followed by the desired command, such as pip install package-name.

            <p class="bg-dark text-white">Question 14: How is memory managed in python?</p>
            <p class="bg-success text-white">Answer 14:  Memory management in Python is handled by the Python runtime itself through a mechanism called Automatic Memory Management or Garbage Collection.

                Python uses a dynamic memory allocation model, which means that memory is allocated and deallocated as needed during program execution. When a new object is created in Python, the interpreter dynamically allocates memory for it from the heap. When an object is no longer needed, Python automatically deallocates the memory it occupied.
                
                Python uses a technique called reference counting to keep track of which objects are in use and which are no longer needed. Each object in Python has a reference count, which is the number of references to that object from other parts of the program. When an object's reference count reaches zero, it is no longer needed, and Python deallocates its memory automatically.
                
                In addition to reference counting, Python also uses a garbage collector to deallocate objects that cannot be reached by the program. The garbage collector runs periodically in the background, reclaiming memory from objects that are no longer in use.
